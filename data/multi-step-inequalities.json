    "what_is_it": "A multi-step inequality is like a multi-step equation — except instead of an equal sign, it uses inequality symbols to show a range of possible answers.",
    "symbols": [
      "$<\\;\\text{less than}$",
      "$>\\;\\text{greater than}$",
      "$\\le\\;\\text{less than or equal to}$",

    "Add or subtract to move constants to the other side.",

    "Multi-step inequalities are just like multi-step equations, but instead of finding ONE answer, you're finding a whole range of answers! For example, if $x > 3$, that means $x$ could be 4, 5, 100, or even 3.5 — any number greater than 3 works!",
    "The solving process is almost identical to equations: combine like terms, move variables to one side, and isolate the variable. But there's ONE super important rule to remember...",
    "When you multiply or divide BOTH sides by a negative number, you must FLIP the inequality sign! Why? Think of it like this: 5 is greater than 3, but when you multiply both by -1, you get -5 and -3. Now -5 is LESS than -3! The relationship flips when you go negative.",
    "Once you solve, you can show your answer on a number line (with arrows and circles) or use interval notation like $(-\\infty, 5]$ to show all numbers less than or equal to 5."

  "step_by_step": [
    "Simplify both sides if needed (combine like terms, distribute).",
    "Move constants to the opposite side using inverse operations.",
    "Move coefficients away from the variable by dividing or multiplying.",
