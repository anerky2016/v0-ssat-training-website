      "options": ["18/12", "3/2", "11/7", "6/4"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Multiply numerators and denominators: (2 × 9)/(3 × 4) = 18/12. Simplify by dividing both by 6: 18/12 = 3/2 or 1 1/2"

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "30% of $80 = 0.30 × 80 = $24. Sale price = $80 - $24 = $56"
