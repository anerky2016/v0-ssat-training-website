    "Think of an inequality like $x > 3$ as a rule for where you can be on a number line road. The number 3 is a checkpoint, and the inequality tells you which direction you're allowed to go.",
    "When you see $x > 3$, it means you can be anywhere to the RIGHT of 3 (but NOT exactly at 3). We draw an open circle at 3 to show 'you can't stop here' and an arrow to the right to show 'keep going this way!'",
    "But if you see $x \\ge 3$, now you CAN stop at 3! We use a filled circle to show 'this spot is allowed' and still point right for all the other allowed spots.",
    "The tricky part: when you multiply or divide BOTH sides by a negative number, the inequality sign flips! It's like turning around on the road—greater becomes less, and less becomes greater."
