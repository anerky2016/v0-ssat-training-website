      "answer": "Zealotry",
      "explanation": "\"Fanaticism\" is a fanatic outlook or fanatic behaviour. \"Fanatic\" means marked by excessive enthusiasm and often intense uncritical devotion. Both words share a link with the root \"fan,\" as in football fan. \"Fanaticism\" can also be called \"zeal,\" which is a strong feeling of interest and enthusiasm that makes someone very eager or determined to do something. If you show \"zealous\" behaviour then you are full of \"zealotry.\" To help you \"idealism\" is the attitude of a person who believes that it is possible to live according to very high standards of behavior and honesty. \"Jive\" means a type of fast lively dance or music that was especially popular in the early part of the twentieth century; it can also mean informal language that includes many slang terms.\n\nNotes：",

To solve this analogy, you have to determine what \"agoraphobia\" is the fear of. The correct answer is \"public spaces,\" as the prefix \"agor-\" means related to outside or open spaces.

      "explanation": "A \"drunkard\" is someone who is frequently drunk or someone who is often intoxicated. \"Intoxicated\" is a synonym of drunk. To solve this analogy, you have to figure out what a \"braggart\" is often doing. As you might have guessed from the root word \"brag,\" a verb that means show off or boast, a \"braggart\" is someone who often boasts about their achievements. There are many relevant word fragments and prefixes in this analogy that might have helped you solve it: The suffix \"-ard\" or \"-art\" means type of person who does something, and the word fragment \"toxic\" means related to poison, alcohol being the poison referred to in the word \"intoxicated.\" None of the other answer choices are activities that braggarts are assumed to do often.\n\nNotes：",

The prefix techno-means related to technology, and the suffix -phobe means someone who fears. So a \"technophobe\" means the same thing as a \"luddite.\" To solve this analogy you need to determine the best available synonym for \"memoir.\" The prefix mem- is related to memory, recalling the past so a \"memoir\" is an account of what took place in one person's past. As such, it is closest in meaning to an \"account.\" You might have picked \"narrative;\" however that more closely means story and suggests fiction, whereas an \"account\" is a telling of something that has happened. To provide further help, a \"technophile\" loves new technology, a \"protagonist\" is a hero and an \"antagonist\" is a villain, observe the relationship between the prefixes pro- and anti-.\n\nNotes：",

It begins with the prefix \"ben-,\" meaning good, as in \"beneficial.\" The opposite of this is the prefix \"mal-;\" therefore, \"malevolent\" is the opposite of \"benevolent.\" To further help you, if something is \"critical\" it is very important, \"blandness\" is when something is plain or simple.\n\nNotes：",

      "explanation": "The suffix \"-phobia\" means fear of and the root \"ergo\" means having to do with work, so the word \"ergophobia\" means the fear of work. To solve the analogy, you need to pick out the answer choice that is the thing that someone with \"pyrophobia\" is afraid of. The root \"pyro\" means having to do with fire, as seen in \"pyromaniac\" or \"pyrotechnic.\" Someone who suffers from \"pyrophobia\" therefore is someone who is afraid of fire, making \"fire\" the correct answer.\n\nNotes：",

      "answer": "villain",
      "explanation": "\"Deify\" means consider as or make into a god and \"vilify\" means make into a villain or condemn. So, \"villain\" is the correct answer. If you did not immediately know this, it would become necessary to use your knowledge of prefixes to solve the analogy. The prefix \"dei-\" means related to (a) god(s) or (a) goddess(es) and the prefix \"vil-\" means related to evil doings. None of the other answer choices would make sense in the blank: \"juvenile\" means youthful and immature; \"adolescent\" means teenager; \"ancestor\" is the term used to describe the people who came before us to whom we are related, like our grandparents; and a \"protagonist\" is a hero.\n\nNotes：",

      "explanation": "The root \"aud\" means related to hearing or listening. The only relationship that can be established between \"audience\" and \"audible\" is that they are both related to listening because they both contain the root \"aud.\" An \"audience\" watches and listens to a performance and \"audible\" means able to be heard. The prefix \"cent-\" means related to the number one hundred. A \"centennial\" is a celebration commemorating something that happened one hundred years ago or the existence of something for one hundred years, and a \"centipede\" is an insect with one hundred legs. Like \"audience\" and \"audible,\" the only relationship between these two words is that they are both related to the number one hundred. To provide further help, \"sensible\" means reasonable and smart, \"visible\" means able to be seen, and \"sensory\" means relating to the senses.\n\nNotes：",

      "explanation": "Since someone who is generous is not miserly (\"hating to spend money\"), the two words are antonyms, so we need to pick out a word that means the opposite of \"incorrigible.\" \"Incorrigible\" is an adjective that refers to people or their tendencies, and means \"not able to be corrected, improved, or reformed.\" While \"corrugated\" sounds somewhat like \"incorrigible,\" \"corrugated\" means \"shaped into alternate ridges and grooves\" and is used with materials, surfaces, and structures. Since \"corrugated\" is not an opposite of \"incorrigible,\" it can't be the correct answer. \"Correctable,\" however, means the opposite of \"incorrigible,\" so \"correctable\" is the correct answer.\n\nNotes：",

      "answer": "proud is to ashamed",
      "explanation": "\"Angular\" is an adjective that refers to an object, outline, or shape, and means \"having angles or sharp corners,\" while \"rounded\" is an adjective that means \"having a smooth, curved surface.\" So, \"angular\" and \"rounded\" are antonyms, and we need to pick out an answer choice that also consists of a pair of antonyms. While \"proud is to ashamed,\" \"archaic is to ancient,\" and \"formulaic is to conventional\" might each look like a potentially correct answer, \"formulaic\" can mean \"produced in accordance with a slavishly followed rule or style; predictable\" and \"clichéd\" means \"showing a lack of originality; based on frequently repeated phrases or opinions,\" making the two words synonyms, not antonyms. So, \"formulaic is to clichéd\" cannot be the correct answer. Similarly, \"archaic\" is an adjective that means \"very old or old-fashioned,\" so it is a synonym, not an antonym, of \"old,\" and \"archaic is to old\" cannot be the correct answer either. \"Proud,\" however, is an adjective that means \"feeling deep pleasure or satisfaction as a result of one's own achievements, qualities, or possessions or those of someone with whom one is closely associated,\" while \"ashamed\" means \"embarrassed or guilty because of one's actions, characteristics, or associations.\" So, because \"proud\" is an antonym of \"ashamed\" just like \"angular\" is an antonym of \"rounded,\" \"proud is to ashamed\" is the correct answer.\n\nNotes：",

      "answer": "formal is to casual",
      "explanation": "\"Potent\" is an adjective that means powerful or effective, so it is an antonym of \"weak.\" That means that we need to pick out an answer choice that also consists of a pair of antonyms. While \"formal is to casual,\" \"unoriginal is to imitative,\" and \"silly is to goofy\" might each look like a potentially correct answer choice, \"unoriginal\" is an adjective that means not original, while \"imitative\" is an adjective that can mean imitating a previous work and therefore not original. The two words are synonyms, not antonyms, and \"unoriginal is to imitative\" cannot be the correct answer. Similarly, \"silly\" and \"goofy\" are adjectives that each mean foolish, so \"silly\" and \"goofy\" are also a pair of synonyms and \"silly is to goofy\" cannot be the correct answer either. \"Formal,\" however, is an adjective that can mean done according to rules or stately, while \"casual\" can mean in a manner that lacks formality. Because \"formal\" and \"casual\" are antonyms just as \"potent\" and \"weak\" are antonyms, \"formal is to casual\" is the correct answer.\n\nNotes：",

      "explanation": "\"Abdicate\" means give up a throne or position of power, so it is something a king could do. When an army does gives up power or withdraws from battle, it is said to \"surrender,\" so \"surrender\" is the correct answer. As for the other answer choices, a \"tactic\" is an action or method used to achieve a goal, \"lose\" is to not win some competition or be defeated, a \"skill\" is an ability gained through training, and \"worship\" is the act of showing respect or admiration, especially to a deity in a religious context.\n\nNotes：",

To solve this analogy, you have to determine what situation is taking place if the action of alleviating occurs. \"Alleviate\" means to make better or to pacify, so it is an action that would be taken during a \"crisis,\" a word which means emergency or disaster.

      "explanation": "When a word contains the root \"aqua,\" it usually refers to something having to do with water, so you can tell that \"aquatic\" means living in or near water. Whales live in water. So, to solve this analogy, you need to pick out an adjective that describes where sloths live. Sloths spend most of their time in trees, so you need to find a word that means something like \"living in or near trees.\" \"Arboreal\" means living in or near trees, which makes sense, as \"arboreal\" is derived from the Latin root \"arbor,\" which means tree. \"Amphibious\" describes an animal that lives both in water and on land, whereas \"terrestrial\" refers to animals which only live on land. To help further, \"grounded\" can mean stuck on land or in one place whilst \"mountainous\" describes land or terrain that contains mountains.\n\nNotes：",

While \"hurry is to hustle\" might look like a potentially correct answer choice, \"hurry\" means \"move or act with haste; rush\" when used as a verb, and \"hustle\" can be used as a verb that means \"hurry; bustle,\" so the two words are synonyms, not antonyms, and \"hurry is to hustle\" cannot be the correct answer. \"Heal is to wound,\" however, consists of a pair of antonyms, because \"wound\" can mean \"inflict an injury on (someone)\" whereas heal can mean \"cause (a wound, injury, or person) to become sound or healthy again\" when used of a person or treatment.

      "explanation": "\"Truncated\" is a synonym of \"shortened,\" so to solve this analogy, you have to determine the best available synonym of \"elongated.\" \"Elongated\" means made longer or lengthened, so \"lengthened\" is the correct answer.

The opposite of this would be to \"return\" something that you took.

      "answer": "happiness is to misery",
      "explanation": "\"Candor\" is a noun that means \"the quality of being open and honest in expression; frankness,\" so it is an antonym of \"falsehood.\" That means that we need to pick out an answer choice that consists of a pair of antonyms. While \"anger is to fury\" might look like a potentially correct answer, \"anger\" and \"fury\" are synonyms, not antonyms, so it cannot be the correct answer. \"Happiness is to misery,\" however, is the correct answer, because just as \"candor\" is an antonym of \"falsehood,\" \"happiness\" is an antonym of \"misery.\"\n\nNotes：",

A \"metalworker\" uses a \"welding torch\" to build metal objects. \"Metalworker\" and \"welding torch\" have the same relationship as carpenter and hammer.\n\nA captain uses a boat, but the boat is not simply a tool for the captain, it is the captain's home.\n\nBirds hatch from eggs, there is no user or tool in this analogy.\nChefs make food, but food is not the tool of the chef.\nThe policeman is not the tool of the baton, but vice versa. Analogies must match conceptually, so if you have a user paired with a tool, you need to find an answer that also has a user and a tool.\n\nNotes：",

To solve this analogy, you have to find the word that is most similar in meaning to “magnificent,” which means incredible, beautiful, and great. \"Great\" is the answer choice closest in meaning to \"magnificent,\" so \"great\" is the correct answer.

      "explanation": "“Edifice” is a noun that can mean “a building, especially a large, imposing one” or “a complex system of beliefs,” while “dwelling,” when used as a noun, means “a house, apartment, or other place of residence.” So, “edifice” and “dwelling” are synonyms, and we need to pick out an answer choice that also consists of a pair of synonyms. While “garbage is to dump” and “column is to pillar” might each seem like a potentially correct answer, “trash can” is a place where one puts garbage, but is not a synonym of “garbage,” so “garbage is to trash can” cannot be the correct answer. “Column,” however, is a noun that means “an upright pillar,\" while “pillar” means “a tall vertical structure used as a support.” So, because “column” is a synonym of “pillar” just as “edifice” is a synonym of “dwelling,” “column is to pillar” is the correct answer.\n\nNotes：",
