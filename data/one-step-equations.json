    "Imagine an equation like $x + 5 = 12$ as a balanced scale. On one side you have $x$ plus 5 weights, and on the other you have 12 weights. To find out what $x$ is, you need to remove those 5 extra weights from the left side. But remember – a scale only stays balanced if you do the same thing to both sides!",
    "So if you subtract 5 from the left side (to get $x$ by itself), you must also subtract 5 from the right side. That gives you $x = 7$. The scale is still balanced, and you've found the value of $x$!",
    "The same idea works for multiplication and division. If you have $3x = 15$, you're saying '3 groups of $x$ equal 15.' To find one group ($x$), you divide both sides by 3, giving you $x = 5$."
