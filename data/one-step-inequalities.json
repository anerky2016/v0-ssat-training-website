    "what_is_it": "A one-step inequality is like a one-step equation — except instead of showing equality, it shows how one side is greater or less than the other.",
    "symbols": [
      "$<\\;\\text{means less than}$",
      "$>\\;\\text{means greater than}$",
      "$\\le\\;\\text{means less than or equal to}$",

    ],
    "kid_friendly_explanation": "An inequality is a math sentence that says one side is bigger or smaller. Solving it means finding all the numbers that make that sentence true — not just one answer! The trick is: treat it like an equation, but if you multiply or divide by a negative number, FLIP the inequality sign."

    "Isolate the variable using the inverse operation.",
    "Use the opposite operation to undo what's happening to the variable.",
    "If you multiply or divide both sides by a negative, flip the inequality sign.",

    "One-step inequalities work just like one-step equations! The difference? Instead of finding ONE answer, you're finding a whole bunch of numbers that work. For example, if $x > 5$, that means $x$ could be 6, 7, 100, or even 5.1 — anything greater than 5!",
    "To solve a one-step inequality, you do exactly what you'd do for an equation: use inverse operations to get $x$ alone. Add to undo subtraction, multiply to undo division, and so on.",
    "But here's the ONE SUPER IMPORTANT RULE: When you multiply or divide BOTH sides by a negative number, you must FLIP the inequality sign! $>$ becomes $<$, and $\\ge$ becomes $\\le$. This is because the relationship changes when you go into negative territory.",
    "Once you solve it, you can show your answer on a number line. Use an open circle (○) for $<$ or $>$ (the number isn't included), and a filled circle (●) for $\\le$ or $\\ge$ (the number IS included). Then draw an arrow in the direction where all the solutions are!"
