    "what_is_it": "The Pythagorean Theorem is a rule that connects the three sides of any right triangle (a triangle with one 90° angle).",
    "formula": "$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$",
    "explanation": "In a right triangle, the two shorter sides are called legs (a and b), and the longest side (opposite the right angle) is called the hypotenuse (c). The square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.",
    "kid_friendly_story": "Think of a right triangle like a ramp. The ramp's length (c) is made up of the two shorter sides (the base and height). If you square each of them and add them up, you get the square of the ramp's length!"
  },
  "key_points": [
    "Use the Pythagorean Theorem only for right triangles.",
    "Identify which side is the hypotenuse — it's always opposite the right angle.",
    "To find the missing side:",
    "• If the hypotenuse (c) is missing: $c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$",
    "• If a leg is missing: $a = \\sqrt{c^2 - b^2}$ or $b = \\sqrt{c^2 - a^2}$",
    "Always take the positive square root, since side lengths are positive."

    "Imagine you're standing at one corner of a rectangular park. You can walk along the edges (going right, then up), or you can cut straight across diagonally. The Pythagorean Theorem helps you figure out how far that diagonal path is!",
    "The formula is $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are the two sides that meet at the right angle (the legs), and $c$ is the longest side opposite the right angle (the hypotenuse).",
    "Here's the cool part: if you know ANY two sides of a right triangle, you can find the third! Square the sides you know, add or subtract them (depending on what you're finding), then take the square root. That's it!",
    "Real-world example: If you have a 3-foot ladder base and need to reach 4 feet high on a wall, your ladder needs to be 5 feet long. That's because $3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25$, and $\\sqrt{25} = 5$!"

    "Plug the known values into $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.",
    "Simplify and solve for the missing side.",
    "Take the square root of both sides."
