    "Think of solving $2x + 5 = 15 - x$ like organizing a messy room. First, you gather all the toys ($x$ terms) on one side and all the books (numbers) on the other side. So we move $-x$ to the left (it becomes $+x$) and move $+5$ to the right (it becomes $-5$).",
    "Now we have $2x + x = 15 - 5$, which simplifies to $3x = 10$. Just like a one-step equation, we divide both sides by 3 to find $x = \\frac{10}{3}$!",
    "When you see parentheses like $3(x+4) = 21$, think of it as 3 bags with $(x+4)$ items each. To count everything, you need to distribute: $3 \\cdot x + 3 \\cdot 4 = 3x + 12 = 21$. Then solve normally!"
