    "Explain what it means to simplify a fraction",

    "numerator": "Top number of a fraction (how many parts).",

    "what": "Simplifying a fraction means shrinking the numbers without changing the amount. 2/4 and 1/2 are the same size slice!",
    "why": [
      "Smaller numbers are easier to compare and compute with.",
      "Tests (like SSAT) expect answers in simplest form.",
      "It's like cleaning your desk—same stuff, less mess."

  "how_to_steps": [
    "Look at the numerator and denominator.",
    "Find a number that divides both (try 2, 3, 5… or find the GCF).",
    "Divide the top and bottom by that number.",
    "Repeat until no common factor remains (or divide once by the GCF).",
    "Optional check: Use a prime-factor tree to confirm there's nothing left to cancel."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "If both numbers are even, divide by 2 first.",
    "If digits sum to a multiple of 3, divide by 3.",
    "Numbers ending in 0 or 5 are divisible by 5.",
